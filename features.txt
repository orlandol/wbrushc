Feature Plans for Windbrush Concept
[Updated: 2020-07-04]

- UI components open on click or hover, and optionally stay open
  if locked. Goal of 2 clicks maximum for any available action.
- HSV/HSB color selector with optional numeric input.
- Easy to use animation interface where frames can be dragged
  and dropped around.
- Drawing tablet support, with auto-eraser detection.
- Consistent and optional pixel grid.
- Zoomed pixel editing mode for either the entire work area,
  or through a selected area using a zoom lens.
- Pre-selected zoom presets for fast cycling between desired
  zoom amounts using the mouse wheel or equivalent.
- Optional auto-detection of handedness, adjusting UI for
  right/left handedness.
- Animation preview showing current frame regular sized, previous
  2 frames scaled above, and next 2 frames scaled below.
- Dynamic floating color palette allowing colors to be added to
  either side, in any desired shape, grouped by the artist.
- Pixel extruder tool to "raise" selected pixels.
- Silhouette preview mode.
- Guided pixel tool which attempts to draw clean lines based on
  the current pixel position. May also use direction prediction.
- Image offsetting to edit seamless tiles, etc.
- Clicking and dragging moves the color palette. But clicking and
  releasing selects a new color.
- Isometric pixel grid.
- Internal: Edit images using the display pixel format. Convert when
  loading or saving from a different format. If the pixel format is
  indexed, the floating palette will have an associated color index.
  The color index will be converted to a pixel when drawing.
- Internal: All images will be treated as indexed, where each color
  on the floating palette serves as an index number, and the bit depth
  determines the maxinum number of colors that the floating palette
  can index.
- Internal: Pixel edge tool where the artist chooses the center point,
  and create a custom chisel which rotates towards the center point.
  Pressing the mouse button erases pixels under it.
- Internal: Floating palette behavior - Dragging on mouse/press down
  moves the palette, until release; Draw tool auto-hides palette when
  under it.
