Feature Plans for Windbrush Concept
[Updated: 2/19/20]

- UI components open on click or hover, and optionally stay open
  if locked. Goal of 2 clicks maximum for any available action.
- HSV/HSB color selector with optional numeric input.
- Easy to use animation interface where frames can be dragged
  and dropped around.
- Drawing tablet support, with auto-eraser detection.
- Consistent and optional pixel grid.
- Zoomed pixel editing mode for either the entire work area,
  or through a selected area using a zoom lens.
- Pre-selected zoom presets for fast cycling between desired
  zoom amounts using the mouse wheel or equivalent.
- Optional auto-detection of handedness, adjusting UI for
  right/left handedness.
- Animation preview showing current frame regular sized, previous
  2 frames scaled above, and next 2 frames scaled below.
- Dynamic floating color palette allowing colors to be added to
  either side, in any desired shape, grouped by the artist.
- Pixel extruder tool to "raise" selected pixels.
- Silhouette preview mode.
- Guided pixel tool which attempts to draw clean lines based on
  the current pixel position. May also use direction prediction.
- Image offsetting to edit seamless tiles, etc.
- Clicking and dragging moves the color palette. But clicking and
  releasing selects a new color.
- Isometric pixel grid.
